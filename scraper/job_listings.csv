At InnoEdge, we’re on a mission to protect organisations from ever-evolving cyber threats. While our core teams focus on cutting-edge research and defence, our internal IT environment—and the infrastructure that powers our engineering workflows—needs to be just as secure, resilient, and future-ready.
We’re looking for a hands-on IT & DevOps Manager to lead and support internal IT operations and drive the evolution of our development infrastructure. This role is critical in ensuring both a robust IT backbone and a responsive, frictionless experience for our researchers and developers. You will roll up your sleeves to configure systems, solve complex technical issues, and implement solutions directly.
This is not a purely managerial role—we’re looking for someone who thrives on getting into the weeds of technical work, while also thinking ahead to how we can build smarter, faster, and more scalable systems. As we look to grow and mature our DevOps capabilities, you’ll play a leading role in shaping the roadmap and helping us adopt new tools and practices.
We foster a collaborative culture built on curiosity, continuous learning, and the drive to do impactful work. Whether you're automating systems, solving infrastructure challenges, or supporting high-performance teams, you’ll be a key enabler of our mission.

Perform configuration, setup, maintenance, and troubleshooting of systems, networks, and development infrastructure
Oversee preventive maintenance and long-term IT planning; drive infrastructure and tooling initiatives
Establish and implement IT and IT Security policies; ensure compliance across the organisation
Maintain and support endpoints, servers, and network infrastructure
Manage key systems including Microsoft 365, Active Directory, Group Policy, VMware ESXi, enterprise SAN storage, and backup solutions
Partner with researchers and developers to provide secure, efficient, and well-integrated development environments
Support and improve development workflows (e.g., version control, build/test environments, CI/CD pipelines)
Explore and drive the future adoption of DevOps practices such as Infrastructure-as-Code, containerization, and observability/monitoring
Create scripts and lightweight tools to automate repetitive tasks and improve system management
Manage inventory and support cost-effective procurement of IT and development hardware/software
Supervise internal IT staff (if any) and manage relationships with vendors
Diagnose and troubleshoot issues across IT systems and development environments
Collaborate with team leads and stakeholders to identify technical needs and plan for solutions
Requirements
Strong experience in hands-on IT operations and infrastructure management
Proven ability to directly support technical teams—especially developers and researchers—in fast-moving environments
Willingness and ability to work hands-on: configuring systems, troubleshooting issues, and implementing solutions yourself
Solid knowledge and experience with:
Microsoft 365, Active Directory, Group Policy
Networking and server administration
VMware ESXi, SAN storage, and backup solutions
Windows and Linux environments
Version control systems (e.g., Git), and basic CI/CD workflows
Excellent troubleshooting and problem-solving skills
Experience working with vendors and outsourced IT support
Strong project management, planning, and communication skills
A proactive mindset, with interest in evolving toward infrastructure automation and observability
